Brief description:
Our model aims to recognize if a person has a disease or is at risk of developing it. Our goal is to be able to accurately diagnose different conditions including common ones like Alzheimer's and rare ones like Creuztfeldt-Jacob.
We plan to use KNN for diagnosis and logistic regression to find the probability of developing the disease later-on.
