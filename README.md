Team 9 (Emir, Loic, Shadman)  
Brief description:  
Our model aims to recognize if a person has a disease or is at risk of developing it. Our goal in the future is to be able to accurately diagnose different conditions including common ones like Alzheimer's and rare ones like Creuztfeldt-Jacob.
We plan to use CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for diagnosis and logistic regression to find the probability of developing the disease later-on.
